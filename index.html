    var msg = `&emsp;&emsp;I am sorry to bother you in this way. And I wish you have done your exam well.<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;I had planned to write a hard-copy letter,and actually I did write one two weeks ago. But I didn't find a good timing to give it out,
and I though it would be old-fashioned. Thus here you see this page.<br/>&emsp;&emsp;I was catched by your smile for the first time I saw you, 
just like the LiJian wrote, "I love autumn the best, it's the season that I met you". But I don't know what to do
just like you don't know whether to step forward or backward when in a maze. One of my best friends told me that he had been rejected for many times, 
but he still keeps the enthusiasm. So I decide to step forward and open the Schr√∂dinger's box even if the "cat" might would dead, 
and that's why I made this.<br/>&emsp;&emsp;"A happy life isn't hard to come by. The trick is to not regret the choices you made along the way". 
I made my choice, and it was also the content of that hard-copy letter: I want to know whether I can be the one beside you, 
before you, and behind you, would you offer me the chance?<br/>&emsp;&emsp;Wish you happy every day.`;
